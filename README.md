# CMS_wu14TK

Database name, password and login are written in config.php

DEFINE ("DB_HOST", "127.0.0.1");
DEFINE("DB_NAME","cms_wu14tk");
DEFINE("DB_USERNAME","root");
DEFINE("DB_PASSWORD","mysql") ;

DB structure is a little different as it was recomended. Create it from DB_dump.sql file

It was problem with GIThub push/pull, so all my updates came not on the webserver for a month.
After Hugo's help it was recreated, but not visible in the history.
